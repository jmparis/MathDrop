## Project Structure

This repository contains several mathematical examples, each in its own folder:

- `01 - L'Échiquier inversé/` — Inverse chessboard example
- `02 - 2 Modulo 131/` — Modulo 131 example
- `03 - Pavage de flocons de Koch/` — Koch snowflake tiling
- `04 - Pythagore/` — Pythagorean example

Each example is self-contained and can be run independently. Scripts for setting up a Python virtual environment are available in the `scripts/` folder for both Windows and Linux.

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   - Windows PowerShell: `scripts/create_venv.ps1`
   - Linux bash: `scripts/create_venv.sh`
2. All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` at the project root.

## Running Examples

Navigate to the desired example folder and run the corresponding Python script. For example:

```bash
cd "04 - Pythagore"
launch.sh
```

Feel free to explore each folder for code and visualizations!
